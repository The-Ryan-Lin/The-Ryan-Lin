### üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇMy Data Journey

My journey into the world of data began during my academic years, where I naturally gravitated toward using data to support every research project, business case study, or strategy proposal I worked on. The more I applied data, the more I saw how it could bring clarity to complex problems, especially when it came to making decisions that mattered. That interest took off in a previous role, where I began digging into the organisation's internal sales and marketing data and uncovered insights that helped lead to a **25% increase in sales**. That was the first time I saw the real-world impact of data-driven thinking, and it‚Äôs what set me on the path I‚Äôm on now.

To deepen my skills, I enrolled in the **LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator**, an intensive, hands-on programme focused on using data for organisational impact. I graduated **top of my cohort**, sharpening my skills in **Python, SQL, R**, and data visualisation tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI**. The portfolio highlights from this programme are still available below if you're interested in seeing some of my earlier work.

Since then, I‚Äôve moved into a hybrid **Data Analyst and Product Lead** role at **HTA-Hive**, where I‚Äôve been focused on building data pipelines and **LLM-driven automations** that power our core platform, **Hive Access**. My work ranges from developing human-in-the-loop data validation pipelines to designing prompt libraries for extracting structured data from complex PDFs, all while making sure our exec team has the real-time dashboards they need to prioritise effectively.

Outside of work, I continue to experiment with AI and automation‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs learning new tools like **n8n, Make.com**, or **Vertex AI**, or building things to make life easier. One project I‚Äôm particularly excited to publish soon is a fully automated utility bill calculator I built using **n8n** and **Google Sheets**, which has already saved me hours of time (and headaches) when it comes to splitting bills in a shared flat.
